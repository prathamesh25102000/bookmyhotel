          Rome is a city of layers stretching back centuries. You’re never far
          from ruins or stunning ancient or classical architecture. One moment
          you’re passing a modern building, the next you’re staring at some
          Doric columns from the Roman Republic, a Renaissance-era palace
          designed by Michelangelo, or a piazza centered around a
          Bernini-designed Baroque fountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some cities — New York, London — that offer so many
          attractions, you can’t help but to create a list to check off. And
          then there are others where you just want to wander and absorb the
          vibe and the aesthetics of it all.
        </p>
        <p>Rome is both.</p>
        <p>
          In some ways, it feels like a village, with its venerable, wise
          ambiance, and in others like a cosmopolitan city, since there are so
          many museums, historical landmarks, and great restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, it’s impossible to see everything in one visit. It’s what
          happens when you have a city of millions dating back three thousand
          years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which begs the question: What should you do when you may never come
          back? How do you decide what to do?
        </p>
        <p>
          To help you make the most of your limited time in this iconic capital,
          here is the list of my top things to do in Rome:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5 className="first">1. Walking Tour</h5>
        <p>
          I love taking walking tours. They’re a wonderful way to learn about a
          destination. I recommend Rome’s Ultimate Free Walking Tour or New Rome
          Free Tours. They cover all the highlights and can introduce you to the
          city on a budget. Just be sure to tip your guide at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re looking for a paid guided tour that goes above and beyond,
          check out Take Walks, which offers one of the best walking tours in
          Rome, with expert guides who can get you behind the scenes at the best
          attractions. They can get you behind the scenes like no other tour
          company, including early access to the Sistine Chapel and
          skip-the-line Colosseum tours. If a food tour is more your speed, Get
          Your Guide runs a tasty 2.5-hour tour with 5 stops for just 42 EUR
          while Devour offers an in-depth street food tour and pizza-making
          class for 89 EUR.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5 className="first">2. The Colosseum</h5>
        <p>
          Easily one of the most recognizable and jaw-dropping sights in the
          world, this first-century amphitheater is one of the top attractions
          in Rome. There were 80 entrances/exits in this super stadium: 76 for
          attendees/spectators, 2 for participants (i.e., gladiators), and 2 for
          the emperor. While that might seem like an excessive number, the
          Colosseum could hold a whopping 50,000 people in its day, and getting
          them in and out needed to be done quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buy your entry tickets at the nearby Palatine Hill entrance at Via San
          Gregorio 30, where the line is much shorter, or buy them online (your
          ticket grants access to Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also book a tour with Walks of Italy if you want a more
          in-depth experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Piazza del Colosseo, +39 06-699-0110, parcocolosseo.it. Open daily
          9am–sunset. Admission is 16 EUR.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5 className="first">3. The Roman Forum</h5>
        <img

        <p>
          Once the center of the known world, the Roman Forum today might just
          be stumps of marble and half-standing temples, but it’s one of the
          most haunting sites in town. You have to use your imagination a bit,
          but this swath of dirt and marble was once bustling, lined with shops,
          open-air markets, and temples.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Via Sacra is the main street that cuts through the Forum, the
          place where all roads in the empire either began or ended. Once the
          empire fell, the Forum became a pasture for farm animals; it was known
          in the Middle Ages as Campo Vaccino, or Cow Field. Over the centuries,
          much of the marble was plundered, and the area was eventually buried
          as the center point of Rome shifted. It wasn’t until the 19th century
          that archeologists began excavating and rediscovering the Forum.
        </p>
        <em>
          Via della Salara Vecchia, +39 06-3996-7700, parcocolosseo.it. Open
          daily 9am–sunset. Admission is 16 EUR. The ticket gets visitors into
          the Colosseum and Palatine Hill.

      <div>
        <h5 className="first">4. Explore the Vatican Museums</h5>
        <p>
          Home to the famous Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums house four
          miles of rooms and hallways bedecked with one of the world’s great art
          collections. In addition to the Michelangelo masterpiece on the
          chapel’s ceiling, there are rooms frescoed by Raphael and paintings by
          Da Vinci, Titian, Caravaggio, and Fra Angelico, among others, plus
          halls and halls of ancient Greek and Roman statuary, Egyptian mummies,
          and Etruscan relics.
        </p>
        <p>
          TIP: Don’t join the mile-long line in the morning like everyone else.
          Instead, go after lunch, when you can practically walk right in
          without waiting at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skip the line tickets cost 26 EUR. If you’d prefer a guided tour,
          skip-the-line tours cost 69 EUR and last 3 hours.

          This giant stone structure on the banks of the Tiber began life as a
          monolithic mausoleum for Emperor Hadrian in the second century CE. In
          the Middle Ages, it served as a fortress for the pope, who would lock
          himself inside when the city was under attack. Now that the pope
          doesn’t have to worry as much about sieges by barbarians, Castel
          Sant’Angelo is a great place to wander. The gently sloping circular
          ramps shuttle visitors to the roof, which affords a fantastic view of
          Rome and the Vatican.
        </p>
        <em>
          Lungotevere Castello 50, +39 06 681 9111. Open daily 9am–7:30pm.

        <h5 className="first">6. The Pantheon</h5>
        <img

        <p>
          Built around 125 CE, this “temple to all gods” is one of the most
          majestic buildings still standing from antiquity and an absolute
          must-see any time of day (though morning is the least crowded). The
          then-revolutionary rotunda design became the blueprint for buildings
          for centuries after. Today the Pantheon is the final resting place for
          some of Italy’s most famous citizens, including the artist Raphael,
          King Vittorio Emanuele II, King Umberto I, and Queen Margherita of
          Savoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The building used to have a dynamic copper roof. That is, until artist
          Bernini five-fingered the copper for his 95-foot tall canopy in the
          just-built St. Peter’s Basilica. You can purchase an audio guide for
          8.50 EUR.

        <h5 className="first">7. The Spanish Steps</h5>
        <img
          className="blogImage"

        <p>
          The world’s most famous set of steps were completed in 1725 for the
          purpose of easing church-goers’ ascension up the then muddy hill to
          the church of Trinità dei Monti. The bottom of the stairs features a
          modest fountain by Bernini. The name comes from the fact that the
          Spanish embassy has long been on the square where the stairs spill
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent law makes it forbidden to sit on the steps, so the
          time-honored tradition of eating gelato while lounging on the steps is
          now just a memory. But it’s worth strolling up the stairs nonetheless.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5 className="first">8. Ara Pacis</h5>
        <p>
          The Ara Pacis — or Altar of Augustan Peace — is an ornate marble altar
          made in the decade before Christ’s birth. It was commissioned to
          celebrate the Pax Augusta, the empire-wide peace that existed under
          the rule of Emperor Augustus. Specifically, it was made to celebrate
          the emperor’s own conquest north of the Alps in the year 13 BCE. The
          four walls of the altar show scenes of Roman mythology. Be sure to
          have a look at the interesting depiction of a pig slaughtering on the
          west wall — a common practice when Romans made a peace treaty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The altar was an obsession of Mussolini, who was determined to be
          thought of as the next Augustus. The Ara Pacis, facing the tomb of
          Augustus where Mussolini hoped to be interned one day, is surrounded
          on three sides by Fascist-era buildings. Il Duce wanted to turn the
          area around the altar into a “Fascist theme park.” Fortunately, he
          didn’t succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stark white structure that now houses the Ara Pacis was designed
          in 2006 by American architect Richard Meier. It was the first civic
          building constructed in Rome’s historic center since World War II and
          is a favorite target for conservative politicians, who regularly
          threaten to destroy it.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h5 className="first">9. The Appian Way (Appia Antica)</h5>
        <p>
          The Roman road system was one of the marvels of the ancient world. And
          the Appian Way — or, as the locals call it, the Appia Antica — was
          once a superhighway, stretching from the capital all the way to the
          “heel” of the boot (to the town of Brindisi). The section of “the
          Queen of Roads,” as it’s nicknamed, that lies just outside of Rome is
          now a 6,000-acre public park and one of the best off-of-the-radar
          sites of the Eternal City.
        </p>
        <p>
          The road begins at the third-century CE Aurelian Walls and the Gate of
          San Sebastian and then is quickly met with ancient Christian
          catacombs. Soon the brick-sized cobblestones give way to large,
          irregularly shaped, pizza-sized basalt stones, complete with ruts made
          from centuries of Roman chariots moving up and down the road.
          Crumbling, millennia-old mausoleums and shady umbrella pines flank the
          road, which is completely traffic free on Sundays. Remnants of
          mosaic-floored villas and stadiums line the road and make for a
          perfect excuse for a breather.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style={{marginBottom:"50px"}}>
        <h5 className="first">10. San Giovanni in Laterano</h5>
        <p>
          This gigantic barn of a church is one of the most important in the
          Catholic world. The ornate Baroque and Rococo façade belies its age,
          although it’s the oldest among the four major basilicas of Rome (St.
          Peter’s, Santa Maria Maggiore, and St. Paul’s Outside the Walls being
          the other three). The entire complex, which also consists of a palace
          just across the square (today split by a busy street), was the
          original home base of the pope; until 1870 all popes were crowned
          here. Today, the church is still the official ecclesiastical seat of
          the Bishop of Rome (who happens to be the pope).
        </p>
        <p>
          The basilica was completely renovated in the 18th century and given a
          full flourish of ornate Baroque design. Alessandro Galilei won the
          competition to reconstruct the exterior (giving the façade a more
          palace-like look), and Francesco Borromini was given the job to
          redesign the interior. He left the central Gothic Baldacchino (canopy)
          over the altar, which today appears wildly out of place.
        </p>
