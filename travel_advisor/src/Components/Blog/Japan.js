          I’ve yet to meet a traveler who didn’t love their time in Japan. It’s
          just one of those countries that everyone loves. How can you not? The
          food is rich, carefully crafted, and delicious; the history and
          culture rich and long; the landscape breathtaking; and the people
          super friendly and polite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Japan remains one of my favorite countries. No matter how long I
          visit, it’s never enough. I always leave wanting more. With Japan open
          to travelers again, people are racing to visit! I myself will be
          heading back again this year, and countless people I know are finally
          making their first trip.But the country always seems forbidding to
          many travelers. It definitely still has that “exotic” stereotype that
          makes people think it’s hard to travel around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where should you go? What should you see? How do you make the most of
          your time there? Luckily, thanks to Japan’s size and uber-fast trains,
          it’s very easy to see a lot in a very short amount of time. To help
          you out, here are a few suggested itineraries based on my years of
          visiting that will help you see the best sites as well as get off the
          beaten path and get a real sense of Japanese culture:

        <h3 className="first" >Japan Itinerary: One Week</h3>
        <img className="blogImage" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/jrpass1a.jpg" />
        <h5 className="listText">Day 1 & 2: Tokyo</h5>
        <p>
          Chances are you’ll be starting your trip in Tokyo, since it’s home to
          the country’s biggest international airport. If your trip is seven
          days long, activate your JR Pass right away, so that you can take
          advantage of the free JR trains that run through the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you could easily spend your entire week in Tokyo and not get
          bored, here are some of the highlights:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Visit the fish market –</text> Toyosu is
            the world’s largest fish market. The daily auction here powers much
            of the world’s sushi supply, and it is truly an absolute must-see!
            You can go for free, but food and drink tours of the Tsukiji Outer
            Market are available for around 13,500 JPY.
          </li>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">See Sensoji Temple –</text> Sensoji is
            beautifully painted and sits in a scenic spot near a five-story
            pagoda and the famous Kaminari Gate. There’s a huge statue of
            Kannon, the goddess of mercy, inside the main hall. It’s always busy
            but is worth seeing with your own eyes.
          </li>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Drink in Golden Gai –</text> This
            alleyway of back-street bars is a lively place to drink at night and
            has a bit of a red-light-district feel to it. It is not to be
            missed. Even if you don’t drink, be sure to wander about.
          </li>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Visit the Imperial Palace –</text> The
            home of the emperor of Japan was built in the 15th century, and
            while you can’t go inside, the palace and its grounds are a peaceful
            place for a stroll.
          </li>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Watch a sumo match –</text> If you’re in
            town at the right time, this is a must-do. Tickets sell out quickly,
            so book early. Expect to pay around 3,800 JPY.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have more time, consider taking a day trip to Kamakura to see
          the giant Buddha statue (Daibutsu). It is over 13 meters (42 feet)
          tall and dates back to the 13th century. The journey is around 90
          minutes each way — and free with the JR Pass!
        </p>
        <p>
          For delicious food, some of my favorite bars and restaurants include:
          Uogashi Nihon-Ichi (Standing Sushi Bar), Nemuro Hanamaru KITTE
          Marunouchi, Motodane, Tokyo Whisky Library, Ichiran Shibuya, and
          Uohama
        </p>

        <h5 className="listText">Days 3 & 4: Kyoto</h5>
        <img className="blogImage" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/japanitinerary3.jpeg" />
        <p>
          Kyoto is arguably the most beautiful city in Japan. It feels like
          stepping back in time. It’s nestled into the mountains and dappled
          with temples, gardens, and bamboo forests.
        </p>
        <p>
          With its beauty come lots of crowds though, so try to visit outside of
          the busy summer months. Even with lots of tourists, though, the city
          is still magnificent and has a lot to offer. Some things to see and do
          that you shouldn’t miss are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Visit the Golden Pavillion –</text> This
            famous (and picturesque) temple dates to the 1950s, when a monk
            burned down the previous temple (from the 14th century) while trying
            to commit suicide. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the
            most-visited destinations in the country!
          </li>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Explore Gion –</text> Gion is the
            historic geisha district. Stroll along the main street and see
            ochayas (teahouses where geishas entertain), the small shops, and
            the many restaurants that line the district’s streets. You can take
            a walking tour of Gion for 1,600 JPY.
          </li>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Wander in the Bamboo Forest –</text> For
            a relaxing break, head to Arashiyama and let the calm swaying of the
            forest envelop you. Located near the famous Tenryu-ji temple, it’s
            one of the most beautiful places in the entire country (arrive early
            if you want to enjoy it without the crowds).
          </li>
          <li className="blogList">
            <text className="listText">Admire Ryoan-ji temple –</text> This is
            my favorite temple in Kyoto. It’s also a UNESCO World Heritage Site
            and home to a mausoleum that houses the remains of seven emperors.
            The traditional rock and sand garden is considered one of the best
            in the country.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For a half-day trip, you can also visit Nara. It’s a small city just
          one hour from Kyoto. Nara was the capital of Japan in the eighth
          century, so there are lots of buildings and temples here that are
          upwards of a thousand years old (which is rare in Japan, due to fires,
          as well as World War II). The real draw in Nara are the deer. Since
          the 17th century, those in and around the city have been considered
          sacred. You can buy crackers to feed them or just watch them stroll
          around carefree.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h5 className="listText">Day 5: Osaka</h5>
        <img className="blogImage" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/japanitinerary4.jpeg" />
        <p>
          Osaka is the third-largest city in the country. It’s the financial
          capital of the country, but I come for the food. Mouth-watering sushi
          and sashimi, Kobe beef and Japanese BBQ, and flavorful ramen can all
          be found here in abundance. Plus there are local specialties like
          okonomiyaki (a savory pancake with egg and vegetables) and kushikatsu
          (skewered kebabs). You can take a food tour for around 12,000 JPY or
          just wander and eat. That’s all I do: eat, eat, eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t miss Osaka Castle though. While it’s not the original (this
          version dates to 1931), it’s nevertheless an impressive sight. It’s
          home to a small but insightful museum and an observation deck that
          offers some picturesque city views.
        </p>
        <p>
          And be sure to stroll down Dotonbori (ideally at night), the main
          street, which is lined with restaurants, stores, and tons of neon
          lights and signs.
        </p>

        <h5 className="listText">Day 6: Hiroshima</h5>
        <img className="blogImage" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/japanitinerary5.jpeg" />
        <p>
          On August 6, 1945, Allied forces dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
          It was the first time a nuclear weapon was dropped on a city, and it
          had devastating consequences. Upwards of 80,000 people were killed by
          the bomb and the firestorm it created. Another 70,000 people were
          injured, and 70% of the city was destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Hiroshima is thriving. Don’t miss the Atomic Bomb Museum, which
          depicts the history of the city before and after that fateful day. It
          has photos, artifacts, videos, and information about the effect of
          radiation on the population. It’s a sobering experience but one that
          should not be missed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel like getting out of town afterward, head to Miyajima, an
          island that offers a place to hike and enjoy nature. You can also take
          a cable car to the peak of the mountain to take in the view. A one-way
          ferry ride to the island takes 10 minutes and is free to JR Pass
          holders.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5 className="listText">Day 7: Tokyo</h5>
        <img className="blogImage" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/tokyonight.jpeg" />
        <p>
          Head back to Tokyo for your flight home. It’s just under four hours on
          the bullet train, so you’ll have time to explore a bit more before you
          leave!
