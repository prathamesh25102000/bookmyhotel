          Berlin is eclectic. It’s wild and raucous but also sophisticated and
          cool. Home to artists and creative types of all stripes, it’s
          somewhere you can reinvent yourself and be whoever you want to be. The
          largest city in the European Union and the capital of Germany, Berlin
          is also the capital of the 20th century. Nearly every history-making,
          world-changing event of the last century somehow passed through this
          metropolis: World War I, World War II, the Cold War (and its dramatic
          end: the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989).
        </p>
        <p>
          And while it’s fortunately not making such dramatic history these
          days, Berlin looks to be a star of the 21st century too. It’s the
          place on the planet to party and go clubbing. It still draws artistic
          types from all over the world. And it’s a huge hub for digital nomads
          and entrepreneurs, owing to the country’s popular freelancer visa. It
          may not be the prettiest city in Europe, but what it lacks in physical
          aesthetics, it more than makes up for in its oh-so-cool vibe and
          energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it has some great neighborhoods too, each with its own
          characteristics and personality. The “it” neighborhood seems to always
          be shifting, which means there is an ever-expanding list of amazing
          places to stay — no matter your interest or budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help you make the most of your time in this lively place, here’s my
          list of the best neighborhoods in the city so you know exactly where
          to stay in Berlin during your next trip.

          But before we dive in, here are some of the most frequently asked
          questions I get on Berlin:
        </p>
        <strong>What is the best neighborhood for budget travelers?</strong>

          , some of them free, such as seeing the largest existing section of
          the Berlin Wall. And there are also a lot of affordable accommodation
          options here too.
        </p>
        <strong>What is the best neighborhood for families?</strong>

          has been compared to Park Slope, Brooklyn, because it once attracted
          young hipsters who eventually coupled up, had kids, and stayed in the
          neighborhood. Today this hilly district is filled with hip families
          and a lot of great restaurants and cafés.
        </p>
        <strong>What is the best neighborhood for partyers?</strong>
        <p>
          There are amazing party places all over Berlin, but if you want the
          most centrally located neighborhood for letting off some
          Teutonic-scale steam, head to{" "}

          is located in the middle of town and is home to many of the main
          sights, including the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, and the
          Reichstag. If you plan to play tourist and see the highlights, this is
          the best place to base yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, with those questions answered, here’s a breakdown of where to stay
          in Berlin, with suggested accommodations for each:

        <p>
          Located in the erstwhile East Berlin, Friedrichshain is a fun and
          budget-friendly neighborhood to plant yourself in for a while. For
          starters, there are a lot of affordable accommodation options here.
          And there are a ton of cheap restaurants, bars, and cafés lining the
          leafy streets, especially around the Boxhagener Kiez (Platz), the most
          bustling swath of Friedrichshain.There are also a lot of free things
          to do, such as admiring the longest, still-existing stretch of the
          Berlin Wall and also walking (or biking) down Karl Marx Allee, a long,
          wide boulevard flanked by one of the most impressive collections of
          Stalinist architecture on the planet.

              to hang out in the lobby with your laptop. The excellent in-house
              restaurant encourages you to stick around too, with its delicious
              and impressive menu. The rooms are minimalist but very

          There are many faces of Kreuzberg. There’s a slightly dangerous
          element in one part. There’s a grungy, punk-rock part. There’s an
          industrial part. And then there’s the section that runs along the
          Landwehr Canal. This is likely the most charming, aesthetically
          pleasing part of Berlin. The nearby streets are lined with tranquil,
          often sophisticated, restaurants, and the banks of the canal itself
          are a fun place to linger, sipping on a drink while watching boats and
          barges float by.

        <p>
          About a decade ago, Neukölln was deemed the new “hip” neighborhood.
          But instead of losing the title to another district, Neukölln has
          remained one of the coolest places to hang out. It has a large Turkish
          community, so there are plenty of great kabob places to scarf down
          some delicious (and affordable) food. And around each corner, there
          seem to be great bars packed with cool kids from all over the place.
          It’s a popular neighborhood for students and artists, so it has a very
          young, hip feel.

              and one of the most famous hotels in Europe. Located right across
              the street from the Brandenburg Gate, it has all the charm and
              style of an über-luxurious Old World hotel. There have been a lot
              of famous events in its history, not least that day in November
              2002 when Michael Jackson dangled his infant son out of a window
              here.
