        </span>
        <p style={{ marginTop: "26px" }}>
          A hub for hippies, yogis, and digital nomads, Bali is one of the most
          popular destinations in Southeast Asia. It was popular when I first
          started going in 2010 and has only increased in popularity. While
          parts of Bali struggle with overtourism (I’m looking at you, Kuta
          Beach), there are still massive swaths of the island where you can get
          away from the crowds and enjoy the picture-perfect landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a legion of amazing things to see and do on this island — no
          matter your interests or budget. Hiking, surfing, sunbathing,
          exploring the unique food scene, taking a cooking class, spotting
          wildlife, visiting hot springs, and just chilling out are all popular
          activities in Bali. Choosing a hostel near the things you want to see
          and do will save you money as well — money you can then spend on
          another yoga class or diving trip or a round of beers at the bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before you start browsing for a hostel, here are four things you
          need to remember before picking a place to stay:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <text className="listText">Location –</text> Bali is a large island
            dotted with various towns and villages. So, picking your hostel in a
            location you want to be based in is essential.
          </li>
          <li>
            <text className="listText"> Price –</text> As in any destination,
            you get what you pay for. If you pick a really cheap hostel, you’re
            probably going to get one that is small and cramped and doesn’t
            offer great service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <text className="listText">Amenities –</text> Every hostel offers
            free Wi-Fi, and most have self-catering facilities so you can cook
            your own meals. Many — but not all — include free breakfast, so be
            sure to do your research to find the one that best meets your needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <text className="listText">Staff –</text> All the hostels listed
            here have an amazing staff who are super friendly and knowledgeable.
            Even if you don’t end up staying at one of the places listed below,
            be sure to look up reviews so you have staff who are helpful and
            friendly. They can make or break a hostel!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Below is my list of the best hostels in Bali. If you don’t want to
          read the longer list below, the following are the best in each

        <p>
          Set right on Hanoman Street, one of the main drags in Ubud,
          Indraprastha is a favorite among returning visitors because there are
          no dorm rooms. The guesthouse is entirely made up of affordable
          private rooms of varying sizes, with rooms for solo travelers,
          couples, and groups. The rooms are spacious and have AC, and the
          comfortable mattresses are set on sturdy wooden frames. Some have
          balconies and en suite bathrooms as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          On-site amenities include a lush tropical garden that’s attached to
          the two-story guest house, a lovely terrace, an extra-large common
          kitchen, and friendly staff. In addition to being in the center of it
          all, Indraprastha is nicely positioned for the hiking trails around
          Ubud too.

        <p>
          A ten-minute walk to the beach in Seminyak, just north of Kuta, and
          about a 20-minute drive from the airport on the west coast of Bali,
          Gelatik is a comfortable and affordable spot that offers complimentary
          breakfast, and their bar sells fresh-squeezed juice, local beer, and
          tasty local eats. The staff can help you book all kinds of tours and
          activities too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The B&B has two main dorm rooms: one that’s mixed and one female-only.
          The wooden bunk beds are sturdy and, most importantly, very
          comfortable. There are no curtain shades, but some of the wood
          paneling helps adds a little bit of privacy. The property also has a
          swimming pool, a communal kitchen, and some terraces to take in the
          fresh Bali air.

        <p>
          Located in Uluwatu, in the southern tip of Bali on the Bukit
          Peninsula, Karma Backpackers is loaded with great perks: an airport
          shuttle to and from the hostel, a scooter rental service, boat
          tickets, and a free communal dinner for guests every night (which is a
          great way to meet other travelers). The hostel is also located just a
          short walk to and from the beach.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the garden, there’s a small pool to soak in and the rooftop bar is
          a lively place to hang out and drink and play billiards with other
          backpackers. The spacious dorm rooms mostly only have four beds per
          room, and each person gets two lockers. Each bed has its own curtain
          for privacy. There are also large private rooms with comfy double
          beds.

        />
        <p>
          Clandestino, located north of the airport in Canggu, has a handful of
          mixed sleeping spaces on offer and all the dorm beds come with
          lockers, lamps, electrical outlets to charge your phone, and curtains
          for privacy. (Pro tip: book a bed in the six-person dorm: it’s the
          only room that has an en suite bathroom).
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a second-floor restaurant/bar that always seems to be
          bustling, as well as a pool complete with a swim-up bar for those days
          when you just want to relax by the pool. If you’re looking for a
          hostel with a strong party vibe, this is the place to stay. The staff
          are really friendly and can also help you plan your trip and book
          excursions around the island.

          Aimed mostly (but not exclusively) at female travelers, this boutique
          wellness-focused hostel in Ubud is slightly more expensive than other
          hostels in Bali, but it’s well worth the splurge, given the unique
          perks here. The property has a swimming pool and offers yoga, Pilates,
          fitness, and meditation classes. There are also movie nights and
          cooking classes. The in-house eatery serves only vegetarian and vegan
          dishes and breakfast is included with your stay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rooms consist of a few four-person shared sleeping quarters and
          the beds are bigger than your usual hostel mattress. They all have
          balconies, air conditioning, and individual lockers to ensure your
          things are safe and secure.

          Created by fellow budget backpacker Will Hatton, Tribal is a brand-new
          hotel, the first in Bali specifically designed for digital nomads.
          There’s a 24/7 coworking space with super-fast Wi-Fi, tons of desks,
          sofas, and beanbags, as well as private booths for calls and lots of
          power outlets.When you’re done working, chill out in one of the many
          common areas (including a huge multi-level pool), enjoy the healthy
          and varied menu at the cafe, or grab a drink at the
          backpacker-friendly happy hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dorms have modern pod-style beds that have individual charging outlets
          and reading lamps. There are also stairs to the upper bunks rather
          than the usual noisy bunk bed ladders, and rain showers in the huge
          shared bathrooms. The guests that Tribal attracts are a laidback,
          young professional crowd, meaning that everyone is quiet and
          respectful at night — you’ll get a great night’s sleep here!
